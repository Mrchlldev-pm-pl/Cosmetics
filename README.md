# DEVELOPER'S NOTES
- This is open source code. I don't mind you modifying it or using it in your own projects. (Hell, the idea behind cosmetics on a server is blatantly unoriginal and isn't anywhere close to being mine.) I *do* mind you claiming it as your own. Now, don't get me wrong, if you've modified it so much that it isn't mine anymore, think  [Trigger's Broom](https://www.google.com/search?q=trigger%27s+broom+paradox&client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=APwXEdc1u_76uVhyauhqF9XRAS44DR-fVQ%3A1684873372396&ei=nCBtZK7gF7ax5NoPrb-nuAE&ved=0ahUKEwiunum2ooz_AhW2GFkFHa3fCRcQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=trigger%27s+broom+paradox&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIICAAQgAQQiwM6CggAEEcQ1gQQsAM6CggAEIoFELADEEM6DQguEIoFENQCELADEEM6BwgAEIoFEEM6BQgAEIAEOgYIABAWEB46CQgAEBYQHhCLA0oECEEYAFCtAli5DGChE2gBcAF4AIABb4gBiAaSAQM1LjOYAQCgAQHIAQq4AQPAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) type shit, I don't care anymore. 
- If you would like to review this plugin I'd love to see it! I welcome all sharing and distribution of this. Additionally, constructive criticism is what we call *poggers*. Give me your honest opinions.
- There *is* a pride cape included in the resources bundle. I understand that not everyone shares my personal beliefs, and that is completely alright! You have the right to your own, and I respect that. As such, this is disabled by default, but if you want it, you can always set 'enabled' to true in the capes.yml file.

# DISCLAIMER
I'll be real here, my dudes. A lot of this code is sloppy because I gutted it out of my much older projects. I can't be asked to polish it right now. Some of the code in SkinUtils isn't even mine. I tried to credit who I could. 

# CAPE/CLOTHES COMMISSIONS
If you don't want to make your own assets and you want more than the bundled ones, join the Discord server at the top of this README. My prices are... very cheap.
